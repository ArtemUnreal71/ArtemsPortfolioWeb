                    This was my first big project in programming. It was given to my class by our programming
                    teacher.Everybody worked separately at home, but sometimes we have helped each other.<br> <br>
                    Main task was to understand OOP basics, and learn how to work with filesystem. This project took me
                    about month and a half. There were checkpoints (something like deadlines) each week.<br> <br>
                    On the checkpoint day teacher marked our work that we were doing through whole week and gave us some
                    hints, how to resolve some issues. Also, he gave us milestone for the next week (it could be copying
                    files, editing files etc...) <br> <br>
                    Our task was to recreate well known file manager, The Midnight Commander, from the era of Windows
                    95. We had to recreate it in command line where each element like border, buttons etc. was
                    represented by char.<br> <br>
                    A concept was simple: We have an App class, that contains Window instance (current selected Window).
                    The Window has Refresh() method, that refreshes the whole command line. There are other methods
                    depending on what Window is selected, for example MainWindow had method for moving cursor or opening
                    files.
                    In the Window we have cursor, that can go through files and directories from current directory by
                    using DirectoryInfo and FileInfo classes. Also, there is Action event for pressing hot keys
                    (...F4,F5,F6...) that opens new PopUpWindow with options
                    over the current Window. Then, depending on which button you press opens appropriate PopUpWindow
                    with unique buttons and Methods. The final part of MC was editing text files through another
                    instance of the Window with whole functionality (Copy, Move, Save...).
                    However, I haven't completed this part, because lack of time and skill.
                </p>

                    This was group project. We had a team from 3 people. Everybody took a part in each part of the
                    project (I took the biggest part in every aspect). We had 3 separate programs which communicated
                    with eachother.
                    It was Daemon (Program running on the background of computer and communicating with an API), Admin
                    (Angular single page web, that Communicates with the database through the API) and the API (C#
                    project,
                    that provides communication between Admin and Daemon + provides connection to database through MySQL
                    framework) <br> <br>
                    Point of the project was to create application, that allows you to back-up selected directories into
                    another directories (Ideally, even on other device through FTP but unfortunately, me and my team
                    managed to create only local back-ups)
